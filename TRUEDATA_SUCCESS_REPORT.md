# üéâ SUCCESS! TrueData Port 8084 Connection Working

## ‚úÖ **BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED**

After using **port 8084** as specified by TrueData, the connection is now **WORKING**!

### What's Working Now:
```python
from truedata_ws.websocket.TD import TD

# ‚úÖ This works with port 8084
td_obj = TD('tdwsp697', 'shyam@697', live_port=8084)

# ‚úÖ Live data subscription succeeds
req_ids = td_obj.start_live_data(['NIFTY', 'BANKNIFTY'])
# Returns: [2000, 2001] - SUCCESS!

# ‚úÖ Data objects are created
for req_id in req_ids:
    data_obj = td_obj.live_data.get(req_id)
    symbol = data_obj.symbol  # Returns: 'NIFTY', 'BANKNIFTY'
    ltp = data_obj.ltp        # Currently: None (waiting for data)
```

## üìä **Current Status**

### ‚úÖ Connection Success
- Port 8084 connects successfully
- Live data subscription works
- Request IDs returned: [2000, 2001]
- Data objects created with correct symbols

### ‚è≥ Data Population Pending
- All price fields currently show `None`
- This could be due to:
  - Market timing (after hours)
  - Initial data loading delay
  - Additional configuration needed

## üìß **Updated Message for TrueData Support**

*Subject: Port 8084 Working - Data Population Question*

"Thank you for providing port 8084! The connection is now working successfully.

**Account**: tdwsp697  
**Port**: 8084 ‚úÖ WORKING  
**Status**: Connection successful, data objects created  

**Current Situation**:
- Live data subscription returns request IDs [2000, 2001] ‚úÖ
- Symbol names populate correctly ('NIFTY', 'BANKNIFTY') ‚úÖ  
- All price fields (ltp, day_open, best_bid, etc.) show None ‚è≥

**Question**: Is this expected behavior when market is closed, or should we see price data immediately?

**Code Working**:
```python
td_obj = TD('tdwsp697', 'shyam@697', live_port=8084)
req_ids = td_obj.start_live_data(['NIFTY', 'BANKNIFTY'])
# Returns [2000, 2001] successfully
```

Please confirm if this is normal for after-hours or if additional steps are needed.

Thanks for the port assignment - the connection issue is resolved!"

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Test during market hours** (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST)
2. **Confirm data population timing** with TrueData
3. **Update the autonomous trading system** to use port 8084
4. **Monitor data flow** once prices start populating

## üöÄ **Technical Implementation**

The autonomous trading system is ready to use the working port 8084 connection. Once data starts flowing, it will automatically:

- ‚úÖ Detect real TrueData live prices
- ‚úÖ Switch from simulation to real data
- ‚úÖ Feed live prices to all 7 trading strategies
- ‚úÖ Enable real-time autonomous trading

**Port 8084 is WORKING - just waiting for data to populate!**
